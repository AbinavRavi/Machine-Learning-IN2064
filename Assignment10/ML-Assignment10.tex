	\section{PCA and SVD}
	\subsection*{Problem 1:}
	The model $y=Ax$ is a noiseless transformation since we haven't included the bias.Given that
	
	$p(z) = \mathcal{N}(z|0,I) $\\  
	$p(x|z) = \mathcal{N}(x|Wz+\mu,\phi)$\\
	we come to a conclusion that $x$ is a gaussian distribution which gives us results that mean of the distribution is $\mu$ and the variance is $WW^T\phi$.\\ from this we can get the distribution of y with mean and variances $A\mu$ and $AWW^TA^T+A\phi A^T$. From pattern matching we can say that the maximum likelihood can be written as $A \mu_x$ and $A W_x$ and $A\phi_x A^T$. 
	
	
	\subsection*{Problem 2:}
	The representation of the new vector in the space is given by [0,3,0,0,4].So the new Matrix M looks like
	\begin{Bmatrix}
	1&1&1&0&0\\
	3&3&3&0&0\\
	4&4&4&0&0\\
	5&5&5&0&0\\
	0&0&0&4&4\\
	0&0&0&5&5\\
	0&0&0&2&2\\
	0&3&0&0&4\\
	\end{Bmatrix}
 The SVD of the matrix gives U,V,and S which gives the singular values and vector. Now to do dimensionality reduction we take only top K singular values of the output and we get a P = M*V. as P = [0,3,0,0,4]*V = [1.74,2.84] which mostly corresponds to the classic movie genre. A good recommendation of the genre would consists of Titanic and Casablanca. Since the previous data consists of Titanic we can recommend Casablanca.
	
	
	
	\subsection*{Problem 5:}
	(a)The Autoencoder cannot have reconstruction error to be zero since it would correspond to PCA and hence has a linear mapping between latent space and the decoder output. This is not a desirable property.\\
	(b) This is possible only in the case of a linear mapping conditions where the entire input is learnt as such.
